# Traffic Sign Classifier in keras
This is an example of using keras for building a convolutional neural network. Starting with a simple architecture we build gradually towards a keras implementation of the [Traffic Sign Classification Project](https://github.com/ksakmann/CarND-TrafficSignClassifier).  The final model boosts the test accuracy compared to the plain tensorflow implementation by about another percent. In 2011 when the competition took place this would have been a 15th place.

## Overview
In a few lines of code we develop a model for classifying traffic signs. The data set used is from the 2011 German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark Competition, see <a href="http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news">GTSRB</a>. The final model reaches a test accuracy of 97.98% without hyper parameter tuning. 

## Getting Started
All code is documented and explained in the iPython notebook `traffic-sign-classification-with-keras.ipynb`.
